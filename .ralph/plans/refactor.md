# Refactor Plan

## Guidelines

- Make small, focused changes
- Run tests before committing
- Commit after each meaningful change
- Keep commits atomic and revertable

## Process

1. Identify code smell or improvement area
2. Plan the refactor approach
3. Apply changes incrementally
4. Verify tests pass
5. Document any API changes
